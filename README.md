#PythonicXsAndOs
This is a simulation of the game X's and O's on the command line, programed in python
Currently this program only allows two people too play X's and O's

The game works today and you can play it by cloning this code

To run the game run the code bellow

python Play.py


Next Steps:

1. Put more comments in

2. Store each placement for the ability to undo a placement

3. export saved games using JSON

4. replay saved games

5. CPU Mode aka neural network

6. Use Graphics library and render this using images

7. Have multiplayer over a network with lobbies


How the placement works

[0,0] [0,1]

[1,0] [1,1]


Issues:
  top bottom returns an error
  one should be able to type in anything they want and get a proper error
