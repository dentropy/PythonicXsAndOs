#PythonicXsAndOs
This is a simulation of the game X's and O's on the command line, programed in python
Currently this program only allows two people too play X's and O's

To run the game run the code bellow


python Play.py

Plan:
- document
- find bugs


Next Steps:
- CPU Mode and or neural network
    No clue how to do this currently
    google tensorflow tutorials
- Have multiplayer over a network with lobbies
  do this first on command line
- build a web GUI or web app
  have multiplayer and stuff but with a server and a website
- Use Graphics library and render this using images
    Not a fan of python graphics libraries aka need to do more research
- All the same stuff but with Checkers

How the placement works

[0,0] [0,1]

[1,0] [1,1]


Issues:
  top bottom returns an error
  one should be able to type in anything they want and get a proper error
