#PythonicXsAndOs
This is a simulation of the game X's and O's on the command line, programed in python
Currently this program only allows two people too play X's and O's

Next Steps:
1. Use Classes
3. Store each placement for the ability to undo a placement
4. export saved games using JSON
5. replay saved games
6. CPU Mode aka neural network
7. Use Graphics library and render this using images

How the placement works
[0,0] [0,1]
[1,0] [1,1]


Issues:
  top bottom returns an error
  one should be able to type in anything they want and get a proper error
