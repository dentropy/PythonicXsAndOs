#PythonicXsAndOs
This is a simulation of the game X's and O's on the command line, programed in python
Currently this program only allows two people too play X's and O's

Next Steps:

1. Tests Tests Tests
  more strings
  extra spaces
  only spaces
  bad spellings
  one word with a space
  cats
  win

2. Put more comments in

1. Store each placement for the ability to undo a placement


2. export saved games using JSON

3. replay saved games

4. CPU Mode aka neural network

5. Use Graphics library and render this using images

6. Have multiplayer over a network with lobbies


How the placement works

[0,0] [0,1]

[1,0] [1,1]


Issues:
  top bottom returns an error
  one should be able to type in anything they want and get a proper error
