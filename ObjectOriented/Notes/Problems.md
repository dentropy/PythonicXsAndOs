I need a board class/object for all the other classes to change and modify
  Everything needs to be part of a shared data structure
  what information does every single class need
    who's turn it is
    state of the game, win, lose, cats, still playing
    the board duh
I want to learn how to put all the other classes in different files
wrong spelling causes an ERROR
  midle right
